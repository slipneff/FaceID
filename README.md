Title: "Development of a Facial Recognition Program based on Computer Vision Algorithms for Windows Platform"

Abstract:
This coursework presents the development of a facial recognition program using the Python programming language and computer vision algorithms. The main objective of this work is to create a functional system capable of recognizing faces on the Windows platform.

Introduction:
In the modern world of information technology, security is a crucial aspect, particularly regarding the protection of personal data and ensuring confidentiality. Facial recognition has become an increasingly prevalent and effective method for user authentication and identification. It provides the ability to control access to various systems and devices, eliminating the need for traditional methods such as passwords or PIN codes, which can be compromised.

Description:
This coursework focuses on the development of a Python program that performs facial recognition on the Windows platform. The implementation leverages computer vision algorithms, including the utilization of the OpenCV library.

The program comprises several key components:
1. Image Capture: The program enables image capture through a webcam connected to the computer, utilizing the functionalities provided by the OpenCV library. The captured image is then processed and analyzed.
2. Image Preprocessing: To enhance the quality of facial recognition, the captured image undergoes preprocessing, which includes noise reduction, lighting normalization, and facial contour extraction.
3. Face Detection: The program applies computer vision algorithms to detect faces in the preprocessed image, enabling the determination of the face's position and size within the frame.
4. Facial Feature Extraction: Following face detection, the program extracts facial features that are unique to each individual, such as the location of the eyes, nose, mouth, and other key landmarks. These features are used to create a unique face template.
5. Comparison and Identification: The obtained face template is compared against saved templates in a database. Upon a match, the user is identified.

Conclusion:
As a result of this coursework, a Python program has been developed to provide facial recognition functionality on the Windows platform. The implementation relies on computer vision algorithms and the usage of the OpenCV library. The proposed system can be utilized in various domains, including security, access control, and automated identification. In the future, the program could be expanded to support other operating systems and further improve its performance and recognition accuracy.
